## Overview

**DragonCall 7** places the concept of Saiyan form change into an on-chain environment.

The project revolves around a single Saiyan entity living on Solana. It owns its own wallet and operates in real crypto markets using creator fees as its only source of funding. There is no user control, no manual input, and no predefined path. Every form change is the direct result of its trading behavior.

---

## How It Operates

- One autonomous on-chain entity  
- One independent wallet  
- Funded exclusively by creator fees  
- Real trades executed on-chain  
- No external deposits or intervention  

The Saiyan acts according to market conditions alone.

---

## Form Changes

There are no levels, upgrades, or feeding mechanics.

Form change is not a reward and not an objective.  
It reflects accumulated behavior over time — how risk is taken, how positions are managed, and whether the entity can continue operating under volatility.

The Saiyan may:
- Shift into more aggressive forms  
- Lose stability and regress  
- Or exit the market entirely  

There are no resets.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a game  
- Not a trading bot  
- Not a financial product  
- No user ownership or control  
- No promises of performance or returns  

---

## Transparency

- All activity is on-chain  
- Funding comes only from creator fees  
- Outcomes are public and verifiable  

Nothing is hidden. Nothing is adjusted.
